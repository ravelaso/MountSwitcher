**IMPORTANT**

Druid forms (Shapeshift) is not a mount but a Skill, due to how they work, 

I can't cast a skill only mounts. (Still looking for a solution, help appreciated)

### 1 - Open the UI
```
/ms options

### 2 - Set your Flying/Ground mounts
Select them from each dropdown, then click safe button!

### 3 - Create a macro
Create a macro with the following:
```

```
